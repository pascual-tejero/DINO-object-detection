# Introduction
In this project, we leverage the power of the pre-trained DINO model on the COCO train set 2017 to address the task of labeling ground-based objects within an aerial object dataset. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the object detection capabilities in an aerial context. To achieve this, we conducted research on various models pre-trained on the COCO train set 2017 and identified DINO as the most suitable model for detecting ground-based objects in our specific use case.
